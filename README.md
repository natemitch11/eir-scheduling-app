# Eir Scheduling App
This app is a simple scheduling software specific to a healthcare setting. The basic functionality includes a secure login, registration of a new user, creation of new patients, and adding calendar events as appointments to a calendar. The calendar is responsive and each event is clickable, as well as draggable. There is a month, week, and day view for the calendar as well as a marker showing the current day and time. There is a spot for Doctors on the left hand side and when you hover over their name their button changes color to correspond to the calendar events being shown. Each color is unique to 1 doctor.
